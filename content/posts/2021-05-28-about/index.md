## About Big Ten After Dark

This is my attempt at an alternative way of sports blogging. Our goal here isn’t page views or ad clicks. The goal is to dive deep into our love of this family of teams called the Big Ten. We won’t be posting an article just to summarize a tweet for you. We won’t be pulling a quote out of context just so we can post something on a Tuesday afternoon. We will attempt to take a slower, more nuanced look at what’s going on each week. We want to be against the rapid-fire, hot-take culture that currently exists when you talk about sports these days.

I am trying to keep the site as fast and minimal as possible. There are no ads, no cookies, and nothing tracking you across the web. I don’t even know if I will add comments in the future. I might even take away the pictures so you can read it at work.
