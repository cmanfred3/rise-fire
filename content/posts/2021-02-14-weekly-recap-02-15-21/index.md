## Weekly Recap - 2/15/2021

### Michigan is back...under scrutiny

Michigan ended its long layoff Sunday with a great afternoon matchup against Wisconsin with Kevin Harlan on the call. Another game that you just wish you had some crazy Badger fans in the stands for. Michigan got down early but didn’t flinch. The Wolverines first-half offense was good, but the shots just weren’t falling. Livers made a nice jumper right before the half to cut Wisconsin’s lead to 12. Michigan went on to outscore Wisconsin 40 to 20 in the second half, a dominant half that looked more like the Michigan we saw before the long layoff.

Now come the same questions about Michigan that we fielded three months ago about Ohio State football. Michigan hasn’t faced anyone in the top 4 of the conference, yet sits number one with an 8-1 record. Michigan will be hard-pressed to get 20 conference games in before the Big Ten tournament is played. That leaves the Big Ten in a tight spot again. Give Michigan the conference title, even if it has fewer wins? Or crown Illinois or Ohio State the champ, even if they have a couple more losses? I think if Michigan gets to 15 total conference games (they’ve played 9 currently), I think the Big Ten will still give them the trophy. If they don’t get to 15 total games, things could get interesting.

### Notable Scores

**Michigan 67** Wisconsin 59

Michigan’s first game in three weeks. The Wolverines pull away at the end to cap off an impressive half. Livers leads with 20 points and Dickinson puts up a 10 point, 15 rebound performance.

**Illinois 77** Nebraska 72 in 2 OT

Illinois pulls off the comeback, sending Nebraska down to 0-9 in the conference. Nebraska had the last possession in regulation but looked like they hadn’t practiced for it all year. Dosunmu puts up 31 in the win and continues to be on Garza’s heels for Player of the Year.

Purdue 68 **Minnesota 71**

Minnesota ends the week 2-0 after wins over Nebraska and Purdue. Marcus Carr scored 19, including the go-ahead bucket to finish the comeback for the Gophers.

Indiana 59 **Ohio State 78**

Ohio State pulls away from Indiana in the second half to finish the week 2-0. They’ve now won 6 in a row and 9 of their last 10. Most are projecting Ohio State to join Michigan as a 1 seed in the tournament now.

**Iowa 88** Michigan State 58

After losing 4 out of 5 games, Iowa slows the bleeding by 2-0 this week against Rutgers and Michigan State. Iowa has a brutal schedule left. 4 out of 5 games against ranked teams. This is crucial for a team looking to make a run.

Hoop Vision does a 10-minute breakdown on why he thinks Luka Garza is the National Player of the Year. I think if Gonzaga goes undefeated and Iowa is in the 15-20 range, it’s going to be hard to argue for Garza over Corey Kispert. [Click here for the video breakdown

Todd McShay has Trey Lance ahead of Justin Fields in his mock draft. I know Ohio State doesn’t have a great track record with the recent QBs it has sent to the NFL, but the amount of disrespect Fields continues to get after putting up insane numbers in college continues to amaze me.
