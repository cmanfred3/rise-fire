## Welcome to the new era of coaches in the Big Ten

On Thursday, Ohio State went into Iowa and beat the Hawkeyes on their own floor, something only Indiana has managed to do this year. They were able to take a beating from Luka Garza, literally on a few possessions, and pull off the win. Ohio State now has beaten 5 ranked teams, more than anybody else this season, and has cemented themselves as Final Four contenders.

We still have about three weeks left of the Big Ten schedule, but only one opponent stands between Ohio State and its first regular-season title since 2011-12, and it's that team up North. Michigan still only has one conference loss, but should things hold, it looks like the matchup on February 21st could be played for the conference title and a potential one seed. COVID-19 robbed us of The Game this year, so it's only fair that we get it in the hardwood for the Big Ten title instead.

All of this is fitting since Juwan Howard and Chris Holtmann represent the new class of Big Ten coaches here to contend. We might need to throw Brad Underwood in soon too. All three coaches have now successfully made it through the transition program and have implemented their identity on each program.
Howard has the near-impossible task of sustaining the level of success John Beilen had brought to Michigan. Beilen had been to more Final Fours the last 10 years than Michigan State when he left, and Howard has them right back in the same position less than two years later. Howard is also set to add the number one recruiting class in the nation to his freshman-of-the-year candidate Hunter Dickinson. Names on paper don’t play basketball, but it’s safe to assume that Howard has met and exceeded every expectation when he took the job after Beilen’s sudden departure, despite the lack of head coach experience.

Chris Holtmann was tasked with taking over for the equally esteemed Thad Matta. Matta left after never having one season below .500. In his last two years, Ohio State barely missed the NCAA tournament while their best player, Kieta Bates-Diop, missed most of the season with injuries. Holtmann got Bates-Diop back in his first year and has proceeded to go 81-38 since bringing Ohio State to a top-five ranking in the country.

These two men represent the new era of coaches in the conference, and both teams will be leading the charge to secure the Big Ten its first National Championship in over twenty years.
