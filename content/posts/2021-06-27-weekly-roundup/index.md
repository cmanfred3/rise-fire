### Twelve Teams in the Football Playoff? Count the Big Ten In

News broke on Thursday that the College Football Playoff committee will consider a proposal to expand the CFP to 12 teams. The top 4 teams would get a bye and teams 5-12 would play in the first round. This keeps the emphasis on winning your conference championship game to get that bye game. Teams ranked 5-8 would be rewarded with a game on their campus, instead of traveling to a bowl game for the first round.

Let me just speak for the Big Ten right now: Count us in.

If you haven’t looked around in a while, let me give you a glimpse of where we are at. The Big Ten is struggling nationally. Ohio State has assembled a super team on par with basically everyone but ‘Bama, while the rest of the Big Ten is having a hard time matching up. Michigan couldn't keep their end of the rivalry up with OSU and hesitantly gave Jim Harbough an extension after they went 1-5 in bowl games since he arrived. Penn State has had three first round picks since Paterno left (It’s true. I couldn’t believe it either). And Wisconsin has gone 6-5 in their past 11 bowl games. That’s pretty good until you consider they have 4 straight losses in the Rose Bowl. Should we even mention Nebraska? At the rate Frost is going, it’ll take him a decade before he sniffs what Pelini was doing on the regular.

I will admit I’m being a *bit* dramatic here, but recently it hasn’t looked like the rest of the Big Ten has been ready to make the leap and challenge OSU for the Big Ten’s spot in the CFP. And that is exactly the problem with the current setup. In conference’s with a juggernaut, other teams having a great, once-in-a-decade year will be denied the chance to compete unless they go undefeated. One-loss teams, even in their best years, will not be given the benefit of the doubt like OSU or Clemson do.

The proposed 12-team CFP is exactly what college football needs. This will give the programs on the rise the chance to shine. How much more regard would we have for UCF, TCU, Cincinnati, or Boise State had we seen them compete in the playoff? Remember, UCF won 25 straight games, never got a chance to play for a title and only lost to Joe Burrow, Jamar Chase, Justin Jefferson, and the 2019 National Champions LSU.

I’m betting Michigan, Penn State, and Wisconsin would be feeling much better about the direction of their programs if they had played and hosted CFP games the past six years. Can you imagine an opponent heading into The Big House or Happy Valley for a CFP game? Insane.

Those against it say it devalues the regular season, but it’s truly the exact opposite. It makes each game, especially in your division, more important. You can finish second in the conference, make the B1G Championship game in Indy knowing that you have a real shot either way, but a win guarantees you a spot and potentially a bye. A team can lose it’s first conference game of the year but know that a CFP berth is still potentially in reach. A team doesn’t have to hope OSU stumbles for them to have a chance.

Does this fix every problem college football has at the moment? No. The sport will always have it’s issues, especially with top heavy teams. But pretending this isn’t a huge upgrade over the current system is crazy.


### What to Watch

Not much on the schedule leading up to the July 4th weekend in Big Ten sports. You can catch the U19 Men's Basketball team starting the preliminary rounds. The Big Ten has three players on the 12-man roster: Jonathan Davis of Wisconsin plus Jaden Ivey and Caleb Furst from Purdue. Adam Miller, former Illinois guard, is also playing. They will play one game every day from July 3rd and 4th.

[This piece](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ncaa-college-sports-name-image-likiness-nebraska-11624499101) by The Wall Street Journal covered the name, image, and likeness (NIL) changes and what Nebraska is doing to try and be at the forefront of it. Ironically, it features Bill Moos, the Nebraska AD who decided to announce he’s leaving about a day after this story came out. Whoops.
