## Big Ten All-Star Team: East vs West

Recently, many journalists in college basketball have been pushing for a mid-season tournament to take place in late January. Something that would take place on that empty Sunday before the Super Bowl. The NBA and NHL don’t have anything going on. Baseball is still weeks from starting up. Casual fans finishing up their football season are looking towards college basketball and ready to jump in for the last two months till March Madness. While I would welcome a mid-season tournament with open arms, getting the conferences on board with anything other than a Big Ten/ACC challenge will be a challenge.

What I’m proposing would be much simpler to implement. Let’s have a conference All-Star game! This would be an easy way to introduce each conference’s best players to fans, show them the current conference standings, and prepare them for the stretch run.

Let’s see how this would look like for this year. Here are your 2021 Big Ten All-Star starters by division.

### All-Star Teams

West
- Luka Garza - Iowa
- Ayo Dosunmu - Illinois
- Trevion Williams - Purdue
- D’Mitrik Trice - Wisconsin
- Kofi Cockburn - Illinois

East
- Franz Wagner - Michigan
- Hunter Dickinson - Michigan
- Ej Liddell - Ohio State
- Trace Jackson-Davis - Indiana
- Ron Harper - Rutgers

Hardest decisions here who gets the 5th spot for the West. I went with Cockburn over Marcus Carr just because of the team’s success there. You could’ve also swayed me to bump Trice down to the reserves over another Iowa player, but Iowa has been struggling as of late. It’s a good thing no one plays defense in an All-Star game, right Iowa? The biggest issue is this gives us three big men on the starters for the West, but we’ll roll with it. This is why the NBA has positions that have to be voted for, but with a lot fewer players to choose from, I think this is the way to go. The East is pretty stacked to Michigan and Ohio State, but this is an All-Star game, not the All-Big Ten teams. I also think it's hilarious that Michigan State has been at the top of the Big Ten for a while, yet has so little representation here.
Let's go to the bench for each team

West
- Marcus Carr - Minnesota
- Jordan Bohannon - Iowa
- Micah Potter - Wisconsin
- Joe Wieskamp - Iowa
- Jaden Ivey - Purdue

East
- Aaron Henry - Michigan State
- Jacob Young - Rutgers
- Duane Washington - Ohio State
- Myreon Jones - Penn State
- Eric Ayala - Maryland
- Isaiah Livers - Michigan

That leaves Nebraska and Northwestern as the only teams without a representative in the game. Can you blame me though? Both have struggled in conference play and don’t have a player you could put in over anyone else listed.
Choosing the 2nd best player on some of these teams was tough. For Rutgers, I chose Jacob Young to reward him for a great senior year, while adding Geo Baker later in the dunk contest. For Purdue, Jaden Ivey has been up and down, but choosing Eric Hunter over him makes for a tame all-star choice. Ivey's energy and recklessness make for a more entertaining game.

### Who would win?

If the game were taken seriously, I think the West wins this. Initially, you would think the West would dominate, but I think the East team is deeper. Dickinson matches up great with Garza, but I don't think the East will be able to defend on the perimeter against Dosunmu and Trice.

If the game followed the NBA all-star game and was a lot of 3s and dunks, I think it would just be a whole lotta fun. We don't normally get to see these guys have fun and interact with each other until postseason or NBA draft time, so seeing them all play together would be awesome.

###  Dunk Contest

- Eric Ayala - Maryland
- Geo Baker - Rutgers
- Malik Hall - Michigan State
- Trayce Jackson-Davis - Indiana

While Garza and Cockburn lead the Big Ten in dunks, I think the two-handed, rim-rocking dunks they specialize in are more suited for an actual game than an All-Star environment. I think guys like Dosunmu and Jaden Ivey have some bounce in them that would be fun to see here as well.

### 3-Point Contest

- Sasha Stefanovic - Purdue
- Jordan Bohannon - Iowa
- Duane Washington - Ohio State
- Justin Ahrens - Ohio State
- Marcus Carr - Minnesota
- Joe Wieskamp - Iowa

The Big Ten is home to so many good shooters, this barely scratches the surface. Should we go up to ten competing?

### Walk-ons

This is where things could get fun. Instead of having the usual players do the skills challenge, let's have a walk-on from each school compete in the skills challenge. It'll be awesome to see the other players cheering for them and see who can compete. Walk-ons rise throughout the years, sometimes even becoming a key part of the rotation as they become seniors. Let's see the walk-on with the most skill and put them on the radar for the rest of the conference.

There you have it. Big Ten All-Star Game 2021. I think this gives us a good snapshot of the best players in the conference and would be a heck of a lot of fun too.
